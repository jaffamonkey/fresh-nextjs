# Accessibility

> Get an audit at any point in your project, and also get advice on how to ensure accessibility becomes part of mindset, from design to code.

## Accessibility audit

The audit a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. 

Auditing reporting available for web and mobile apps (WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.0).

- Second audit pass post-fixes (optional)

#### Granular reporting

> Embedding accessibility tests in your CI pipeline - you can add lean tools to verify code super-fast!

## Tools

A first important step is to realise Acessibility is a continual improvements exercise.

Just because your app passes in Sprint 5, it doesn't mean it will pass in Sprint 8. 

Treat an audit as a startpoint, to integrating accessibility checks earlier in the development lifecycle.
