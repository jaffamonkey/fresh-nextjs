### Accessibility audit

The audit a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. 

Auditing reporting available for web and mobile apps (WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.0).

### What you will get

- Full reports
- Annotated error screenshots
- Video recordings (for screen reader testing)
- Tools used for testing
- Process improvements suggestions
- Second audit pass post-fixes (optional)

> Add accessibility tests in your CI pipeline

### Tools

A first important step is to realise Acessibility is a continual improvements exercise.

Just because your app passes in Sprint 5, it doesn't mean it will pass in Sprint 8. 

Treat an audit as a startpoint, to integrating accessibility checks earlier in the development lifecycle.
