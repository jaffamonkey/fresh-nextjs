**Get an audit at any point in your project, and also get advice with pushing accessibility as part of your way of working, from design to code to production**

### Accessibility audit

The audit targets a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. 

Auditing reporting available for web and mobile apps (WCAG 2.1).

### What you will get

- A full accessibility review and test of web or mobile app against the WCAG 2.1 AA standard 
-  Delivery of a full, prioritised accessibility report of web or mobile app, which would indicate any elements of HealthWave Hub that are non-compliant and needed to be fixed to achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, the order in which it is recommended non-compliant areas are fixed and details of how each non-compliant area could be fixed. Please note we won’t fix things for you but our outputs will tell you what needs to be done! 
- Either 1 x retest following implementation of fixes and a report updating you on WCAG 2.1 AA status
- Asssistance with training you in automating WCAG 2.1 AA retests for accessibility which can give you continuous reporting per release.
- We’ll test with assistive technologies to aid the results 
- We’ll test with users that have disabilities to give you a rounded view on your Web App’s Accessibility status 
- An accessibility statement (inline with your current accessibility status) that can be published to a website advising on status of WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

> Add accessibility tests in your CI pipeline

### Tools

A first important step is to realise Acessibility is a continual improvements exercise.

Just because your app passes in Sprint 5, it doesn't mean it will pass in Sprint 8. 

Treat an audit as a startpoint, to integrating accessibility checks earlier in the development lifecycle.
