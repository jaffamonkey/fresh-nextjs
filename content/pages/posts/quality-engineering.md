**Helping teams adopt a shift-left mindset - Test strategies - Opensource test architecture - Improving quality in CI/CD pipelines - Pragmatic performance test automation Coaching**

### Transparency

With experience, comes the confidence to be transparent - but many choose not to be, out of irrational fear. It's important to be truthful about project progress - it's not necessary to be datailed on every single issue, but creating atmosphere of trust pays dividends.

### Effective test strategy

It's not fixed in stone, a test strategy identifies ways of working, current tech stack information, and aspirations for improvements. If maintained well, it will become a go-to for everyone on a project. And reusable for other projects too!

### Helping teams shift left

Shifting left with mean putting quality first at all stage in the development cycle, starting at requirements and design stages. This maintains the quality of the input for developers, and less issues to find further down the CI/CD pipelines.  

### A `less is more` approach

Sometimes investing is a feature-rich test framework is a good idea, but starting lean is the best place to start - tests run as part of CI/CD should always be as lean as possible. Packages are there too help you, just be selective and conscious of potential overheads.

### Starting non-functional tests earlier

You can  waste a lot of time focusing on trapping functional errors, but these hold little value in comparisron to testing for performance issues. You donâ€™t need to run a heavy load test to get useful feedback, and developers find these tests useful.
