## About me

I started freelancing in 1997, quickly following a test and qa management route for a decade.  But I was always hands-on, always leaning towards the technical challenges. 

12 years ago, I switched to a more focused technical directions of test frameworks and devops.  With my management skills and experience in dricing process changes, I was able to provide a rounded contribution to project quality - not just test engineering. 

My management style is to lead by example, and never micro-manage. I fimmly believe in transparency, regardless of audience - I consider this one of the most important aspects of my work.
